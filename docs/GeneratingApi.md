import io.cryptoapis.sdk.models.*;
import org.openapitools.client.api.GeneratingApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
    ApiKeyAuth ApiKey = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("ApiKey");

    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //ApiKey.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    GeneratingApi apiInstance = new GeneratingApi(defaultClient);
    String blockchain = "bitcoin"; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    String network = "mainnet"; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
